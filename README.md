Description:
Gather resources, build structures, and progress your technology by researching and taking advantage of real-world science. Start from the ground and crawl to the top in an endless struggle to balance survival with progress. Research different branches of science, and combine your knowledge in them to invent newer, more powerful inventions and weapons. Complete your quest to obtain all knowledge by harnessing the power of the atom. Will you use it to supply yourself with endless power, wipe out enemies with unstoppable nuclear strikes, or both? Some say that in this world there are the hunters, and the hunted. In Tumult, you're both.
